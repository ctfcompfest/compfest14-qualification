## Description
You just found a weird time capsule with a flash drive, and you immediately plug it into your computer (don't try this at home). You found an asm file and a txt file created on 8 May 2015. Try to find out what the asm file does!

## Difficulty
easy-medium

## Hints
* Maybe you can find what microchip it uses from the time capsule date
* Looks like you'll need an lcd simulator to get the output of the program
