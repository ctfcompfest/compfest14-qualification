## Description

A few days back, I was going through my old stuff, and there’s this one letter i found who’s written by one of my classmates back in high school. Damn, I just realised then that it was a love letter. I wanted to contact her, but she changed her phone number when she moved abroad to Austria. Now, I only got her Facebook. If only i knew her email address :(

Can you help me get her phone number? 
Here's her Facebook link https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082501329298

No bruteforce is needed for this challenge.
